# Aircraft Battle Game Prototype

## Game Development Environment

- **Visual Studio Version:** [17.7.4]
- **Operating System:** [Windows 11 Home Chinese Version]

## Gameplay Overview

The game is a console-based aircraft battle game. The player controls an aircraft ('P') and can move it horizontally and vertically using 'a', 'd', 'w', and 's' keys. Bullets can be shot using the spacebar. The objective is to evade enemies ('E') and shoot them down for points. When the player is hit by enemies ('E'), the health will be reduced. The game ends if the player's health reaches zero.

## Exception Handling and Test Cases

The code includes basic exception handling using try-catch blocks. However, the specific exceptions that can be thrown are not explicitly mentioned. Potential exceptions include array out of bounds errors, vector index errors, and issues related to dynamic memory management.

## Further Details

The game is a prototype with room for improvement. Additional testing and features would enhance its robustness and playability.
