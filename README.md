# Aircraft Battle Game Prototype

## Game Development Environment

- **Visual Studio Version:** [17.7.4]
- **Operating System:** [Windows 11 Home Chinese Version]

## Gameplay Overview

The game is a console-based aircraft battle game. The player controls an aircraft ('P') and can move it horizontally and vertically using 'a', 'd', 'w', and 's' keys. Bullets can be shot using the spacebar. The objective is to evade enemies ('E') and shoot them down for points. When the player is hit by enemies ('E'), the health will be reduced. The game ends if the player's health reaches zero.

## Exception Handling and Test Cases

### Exception Handling

This C++ code contains basic exception handling using "try", "catch", and "cerr". Exception handling is used to catch and handle potential runtime errors that may occur during program execution.

## Further Details

The game is a prototype with room for improvement. Additional testing and features would enhance its robustness and playability.
