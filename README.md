# Aircraft Battle Game Prototype

## Development Environment
The code is written in C++ and designed to run on a console-based environment. Visual Studio is likely the intended development platform, given the use of `_getch()` and `system("cls")`. The code should be compatible with Windows due to the use of `windows.h` and `conio.h` headers.

## Gameplay
The game is a simple aircraft battle game where the player controls an aircraft ('P') to evade enemies ('E') and shoot bullets ('*') to destroy them. Player health decreases if the aircraft is hit by an enemy, and the game ends when health reaches zero. Points are earned by destroying enemies.

## UML Design Diagram
Unfortunately, a visual UML diagram cannot be provided in this text format. However, the code contains the following classes:
- `map`: Represents the game map and its properties.
- `bullet`: Represents bullets with coordinates.
- `player`: Represents the player with health, coordinates, and direction.
- `enemy`: Represents enemies with random initial coordinates.
- `score`: Represents the player's score.

## Exception Handling and Test Cases
The code lacks extensive exception handling. It would be beneficial to implement error checking for user inputs and handle potential exceptions in file operations or memory management. Unit testing for individual functions, covering various scenarios, is recommended.

## Further Details
The game uses a console-based graphics approach and relies on the console window for display and keyboard input. The game loop includes logic for player movement, shooting, enemy movement, collision detection, and score tracking.
